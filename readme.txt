In this assignment an implementation of the Color Transfer method detailed in a publication “Color
Transfer in Correlated Color Space” by Xiao et al. The paper presents a color transfer process which
copies the color characteristics of one image onto another. The implementation of the technique has
been completed in Matlab.

To run: 
Save images to same directory as color_trasfer.m
Run color_transfer.m, use "Add to Path" in Matlab to ensure Matlab can access images. 
Uncomment the source image (sourceImg) and target image (targetImg) you wish to use. 
Comment not-in-use images.
